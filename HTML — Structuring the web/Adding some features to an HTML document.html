      (HyperText Markup Language) is a markup language that tells web browsers
      how to structure the web pages you visit. It can be as complicated or as
      simple as the web developer wants it to be. HTML consists of a series of
      <strong>elements</strong>, which you use to enclose, wrap, or mark up
      different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way. The
      enclosing <strong>tags</strong> can make content into a hyperlink to
      connect to another page, italicize words, and so on. For example, consider
      the following line of text.
