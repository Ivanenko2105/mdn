      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>
      or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a
      cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
      including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
      accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
      of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
      formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which
      reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
      the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
      pages that share the file and its formatting.
    </p>

      The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is
      CSS level 1, published on 17 December 1996. Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos
      are credited as the original developers. Among its capabilities are
      support for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Font properties such as typeface and emphasis</li>
      <li>Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements</li>
      <li>
        Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of
        text
      </li>
      <li>Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements</li>
      <li>Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements</li>
      <li>
        Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes
      </li>
    </ul>
    <button>Change user</button>
