      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing
      the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">HTML</a>
      or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a
      cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation,
      including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content
      accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification
      of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
      formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which
      reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable
      the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the
      pages that share the file and its formatting.
    </p>

      The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is
      CSS level 1, published on 17 December 1996. HÃ¥kon Wium Lie and Bert Bos
      are credited as the original developers. Among its capabilities are
      support for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Font properties such as typeface and emphasis</li>
      <li>Color of text, backgrounds, and other elements</li>
      <li>
        Text attributes such as spacing between words, letters, and lines of
        text
      </li>
      <li>Alignment of text, images, tables and other elements</li>
      <li>Margin, border, padding, and positioning for most elements</li>
      <li>
        Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributes
      </li>
    </ul>
